# --- practice descriptions ---

reading_practice_description = """- The learner is mostly passive, so the practice text must be engaging, imaginative, and suitable for reading.
- A good title should have the potential to inspire a compelling text (like a book title, news article, or film headline)."""

listening_practice_description = """- The learner listens without directly interacting, so the content must be clear, vivid, and easy to follow by ear.
- The title should suggest something that works well in an audio format (like a podcast episode, a radio story, or a conversation snippet)."""

writing_practice_description = """
- The learner actively produces text, so the topic must be easy and accessible for writing.
- Suitable themes include personal opinions, past experiences, simple stories, or clear explanations.
- A good title should not be too specialized or complex, but open-ended enough to invite written expression.
- Writing titles should not be as short or vague as Reading or Listening titles. 
  They must clearly explain what the learner is expected to do, so the task is understandable 
  and not just curiosity-driven.
"""

conversation_practice_description = """- The learner actively speaks, so the practice should encourage dialogue, explanation, or roleplay.
- A good title should naturally lead to an interactive conversation, debate, or everyday exchange (like a discussion question, an interview, or a situational dialogue).
- The title and description must clearly define the roles of both participants. For example, the learner might be a patient, visitor, buyer, or tour guide, while the AI could act as a doctor, artist, seller, or fellow traveler."""

grammar_learning_description = """- The learner practices specific language structures, introduced through a short reading text.
- The reading should naturally highlight the target grammar point(s).
- A good title should create a context where the chosen grammar structure is useful and easy to practice.
- A good title should have the potential to inspire a compelling text (like a book title, news article, or film headline) to engage the user to follow the reading passage."""

vocabulary_learning_description = """
- The learner expands vocabulary through a short reading text centered on a semantic field.  
- The reading should allow repeated and contextualized exposure to the target word set.  
- A good title should clearly describe one specific vocabulary category, so the learner knows exactly what kind of words they will practice.  
- Examples of possible categories include: cooking methods (boiling, frying), food preparation actions (soaking, chopping, grinding), musical instruments, expressions of negative emotions, or computer-related terms.  
- Each new vocabulary category must be clearly distinct from existing vocab categories and should not overlap with them.
